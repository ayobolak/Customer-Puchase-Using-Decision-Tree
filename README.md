# Introduction
This repository explores customer purchase behavior using a decision tree classification model. The dataset contains information on customer age, estimated salary, and whether they made a purchase after viewing a social media advertisement. The project demonstrates the use of decision trees for classification and prediction tasks in a business context.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset includes the following columns:

Age: Age of the customer (numerical).
Estimated Salary: Predicted annual income of the customer (numerical).
Purchased: Whether the customer purchased the product (binary: 0 = No, 1 = Yes).

# Objectives
Use decision tree algorithms to classify customers based on their likelihood to make a purchase.
Visualize the decision tree structure to interpret decision-making rules.
Provide actionable insights for improving targeted advertising strategies.

# Tools and Libraries
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
Machine Learning: scikit-learn

# Key Results and Insights
 : "The decision tree revealed that customers aged between 25-35 with an estimated salary above $70,000 are more likely to purchase."
 : "The model achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying customer behavior."
